nap
===

An awesome script that when run, will prevent you from using your laptop,
tell you to take a nap, inform your housemates of this and politely ask them
to be quiet for the duration of your nap (the notification will contain the
time after which they are permitted to make noise again), and then when the
nap is over, set your laptop's volume to 100%, unmute everything and play
horrible, horrible sounds (stolen from freesound.org) until you press the
mute button (at which point the program will die).

It was written after sleeping through a few alarms in my attempts at
polyphasic sleeping.
